This file is here to describe how I did my vim-setup

I got a lot of influence from thise places:

Pathogen:
  Help organize submodules!

  I included pathogen as a symlink to a submodule instead of putting it directly
  in the autoload directory. This way it will be treated in a similar way as
  other submodules.


Syntastic:
  Do syntax checks of code.

  To get this working I needed to install flake8. The problem was that I had
  already installed pyflakes which was in conflict with flake8. So I run:
    sudo apt-get remove pyflakes
    sudo pip install flake8


MiniBufExplorer:
  Keep track of all files opened.

  This works pretty well out of the box, but there is a really anoying thing
  that happends if you whant to switch buffers without saving first. If you get
  the message:
    E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
  then you need to put "set hidden" in the vimrc-file.

  Since I do not whant to use any of the proposed key-mappings to change window
  (they are already catched in a higher level, the X-windowing system for
  example), I have mapped the "ยง" button to the bufferswitching. This button is
  on my Swedish keyboard the never used button between <TAB> and <ESC>. This
  works really great for me I think!


Speller:
  To get some spelling help.

  This is not a regular module loaded from github. Its a builtin thing which
  already exists in vim. But to make it easy to work with I have a personal
  plugin to do some key-mapping (.vim/plugin/speller.vim).
