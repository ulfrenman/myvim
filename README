===========================================================================
This file is here to describe how I did my vim-setup
===========================================================================

I got a lot of influence from thise places:
    http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/
    http://nvie.com/posts/vim-flake8-flake8-for-vim/
    http://sontek.net/blog/detail/turning-vim-into-a-modern-python-ide
    https://github.com/Meldanya/dotfiles

Pathogen:
  Help organize submodules!

  I included pathogen as a symlink to a submodule instead of putting it directly
  in the autoload directory. This way it will be treated in a similar way as
  other submodules.


Syntastic:
  Do syntax checks of code.

  To get this working I needed to install flake8. The problem was that I had
  already installed pyflakes wich was in conflict with flake8. So I run:
    sudo apt-get remove pyflakes 
    sudo pip install flake8


MiniBufExplorer:
  Keep track of all files opened.

  This works pretty well out of the box, but there is a really anoying thing
  that happends if you whant to switch buffers without saving first. If you get
  the message:
    E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
  then you need to put "set hidden" in the vimrc-file.

  Since I do not whant to use any of the proposed key-mappings to change window
  (they are already catched in a higher level, the X-windowing system for
  example), I have mapped the "ยง" button to the bufferswitching.

Speller:
  To get som spelling help.

  This is not a regular module loaded from github. Its a builtin thing which
  already exists in vim. But to make it easy to work with I have a personal
  plugin to do some key-mapping (.vim/plugin/speller.vim). 

  The language files for swedish needs to be downloaded aswell with:
    curl -o spell/sv.utf-8.spl ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/sv.utf-8.spl
    curl -o spell/sv.utf-8.sug ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/spell/sv.utf-8.sug
